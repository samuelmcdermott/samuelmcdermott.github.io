  abstract={Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables training models across multiple decentralized data sources without exchanging raw data. This approach has gained significant attention in healthcare due to the increasing availability of electronic health records and the need to protect patient privacy. In this review, we provide an overview of recent methodological advances in FL for healthcare. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of FL in healthcare, including privacy, security, and data heterogeneity. We review the state-of-the-art FL algorithms, including federated optimization, federated distillation, and federated meta-learning. We also discuss the applications of FL in healthcare, including clinical decision support, medical imaging, and genomics. Finally, we provide a perspective on the future directions of FL in healthcare, including the integration of FL with other machine learning paradigms and the development of standardized benchmarks and evaluation metrics.},

  abstract={Making user interaction with laboratory equipment more convenient and intuitive should promote experimental work and help researchers to complete their tasks efficiently. The most common form of interaction in current instrumentation is either direct tactile, with buttons and knobs, or interfaced through a computer, using a mouse and keyboard. Scripting is another function typical of smart and automated laboratory equipment, yet users are currently required to learn bespoke programming languages and libraries for individual pieces of equipment. In this paper we present two open-source, novel and intuitive ways of interacting with and scripting laboratory equipment. We choose the OpenFlexure family of microscopes as our exemplar, due to their open-source nature and smart control system. Firstly, we demonstrate "OpenFlexure Voice Control" to enable users to control the microscope hands-free. Secondly, we present "OpenFlexure Blockly" which uses the Blockly Visual Programming Language to enable users to easily create scripts for the microscope, using a drag and drop web interface. We explain the design choices when developing these tools, and discuss more typical use cases and more general applications.},

Here we detail the setup and operation of a new form of QPI microscope based on near-field ptychography. We test our system using a range of phase objects, and analyse the phase images it produces. Our results show that accurate, high quality images can be obtained from a ptychographical dataset containing as few as four near-field diffraction patterns. We also assess how our system copes with optically thick samples and samples with a wide range of spatial frequencies – two areas where conventional and Fourier ptychography struggle.},

  abstract = {Quantitative Phase Imaging (QPI) techniques are a set of microscopy techniques that allow us to observe transparent samples, such as biological cells and optical components, in a way that standard optical microscopes cannot. Although these samples do not absorb light they do cause a significant change to the phase of the incident light. QPI techniques map these optical path length variations across a transparent sample to produce high contrast phase images. Additionally, the quantitative nature of the phase images allows for further information, such as sample thickness and refractive index, to be deduced. The purpose of this thesis is to develop and test novel QPI methods and applications based on a diffractive imaging technique called ptychography. The thesis starts with an overview of key QPI techniques before showing the development and testing of a novel QPI technique called optical near-field ptychography. The phase image produced is shown to be accurate and artefact free, while reducing the quantity of data needed for image acquisition, when compared to existing techniques. It is identified that Spatial Light Modulators (SLMs), digital optical devices that modulate a light wavefront’s phase or amplitude across a two-dimensional surface, are increasingly important as components in QPI techniques. To utilise an SLM effectively it is necessary to characterise the modulation response of the device. A novel application of ptychography in characterising an SLM is demonstrated, generating a subpixel resolution of the display over the device’s entire active area. Further developments are then explored in the integration of an SLM with ptychography, with the ultimate aim of developing a new QPI technique with no moving parts. The application of this technology is envisioned in high quality quantitative phase videos.},

The OpenFlexure microscope has been designed to enable low-volume manufacturing and maintenance by local personnel, vastly increasing accessibility.

The microscope is already undergoing trials for malaria diagnosis, but significant product development is still necessary to transition the project from a prototype to a certified in-vitro diagnostic device. In this paper, we consider the engineering work that is needed to move from prototype to product, and how best to structure this work to support distributed manufacturing across Africa. We highlight the need to focus not just on the necessary engineering, but also on documenting this work so it can be understood and reproduced by any potential manufacturer.},

A graphical interface is viewed either in a web browser or in our cross-platform Electron application, and gives basic interactive control including common operations such as Z stack acquisition and tiled scanning. Automated control is possible from Python and Matlab, or any language that supports HTTP requests. Network control makes the software stack more robust, allows multiple microscopes to be controlled by one computer, and facilitates sharing of equipment. Graphical and script-based clients can run simultaneously, making it easier to monitor ongoing experiments. We have included an extension mechanism to add functionality, for example controlling additional hardware components or adding automation routines. Using a Web of Things approach has resulted in a user-friendly and extremely versatile software control solution for the OpenFlexure Microscope, and we believe this approach could be generalized in the future to make automated experiments involving several instruments much easier to implement.},

  abstract ={This paper proposes an unsupervised approach to anomaly detection in bright-field or fluorescence cell microscopy, where our goal is to localise malaria parasites. This is achieved by building a generative model (a variational autoencoder) that describes healthy cell images, where we additionally model the structure of the predicted image uncertainty, rather than assuming pixelwise independence in the likelihood function. This provides a “whitened” residual representation, where the anticipated structured mistakes by the generative model are reduced, but distinctive structures that did not occur in the training distribution, eg parasites are highlighted. We employ the recently published Structured Uncertainty Prediction Networks approach to enable tractable learning of the uncertainty structure. Here, the residual covariance matrix is efficiently approximated using a sparse Cholesky parameterisation. We demonstrate that our proposed approach is more effective for detecting real and synthetic structured image perturbations compared to diagonal Gaussian likelihoods.},

However, access to a microscope can represent a bottleneck in research, especially in lower-income countries. ‘Smart’ computer controlled motorized microscopes, which can perform automated routines or acquire images in a range of modalities are even more expensive and inaccessible. Developing low-cost, open-source, smart microscopes enables more researchers to conceive and execute optimized or more complex experiments.

Its intuitive and modular design—along with detailed documentation—allows researchers to implement a variety of imaging modes with ease. The versatility of this microscope is demonstrated by imaging biological and non-biological samples (red blood cells with Plasmodium parasites and colloidal particles in brightfield, epi-fluorescence, darkfield, Rheinberg and differential phase contrast. We present the design strategy and choice of tools to develop devices accessible to researchers from lower-income countries, as well as the advantages of an open-source project in this context. This microscope, having been open-source since its conception, has already been built and tested by researchers around the world, promoting a community of expertise and an environment of reproducibility in science.},
